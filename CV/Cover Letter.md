**To the Bending Spoons Team,**

I’ve spent a lot of my career thinking about how to make things run faster and smoother, but what drew me to Bending Spoons isn't just the tech stack—it’s the philosophy of "simplifying relentlessly." In a field where it’s easy to get lost in complex "trendy" solutions, I’ve always found more satisfaction in stripping away the noise to build something that actually works.

My time as a C# Programmer at Lunami Games taught me that the best tools are the ones that get out of the way. I built a custom narrative editor because I saw my team losing three days to a task that I felt should only take one. Reducing that creation time by 67% wasn't just about the metrics; it was about making the work day better for everyone on the team.

I’m the kind of engineer who likes to look under the hood. Whether it’s writing a Python-based CSV reader from scratch to keep things lightweight or diving into C++ to squeeze more performance out of a rendering pipeline (going from 30 to over 100 FPS), I enjoy the challenge of first-principles thinking. I don’t just want to write code; I want to build products that people rely on, using whatever tool is right for the job—be it C#, C++, or Python.

I’m looking for a place where I can grow, get my hands dirty, and contribute to a company that values honesty and high standards. I’m eager to bring that same "operator's mindset" to Bending Spoons and help scale the next great digital business.

Thanks for taking a look at my application. I’d love the chance to chat about how I can help the team.

Best,

**Jialiang Xin**
