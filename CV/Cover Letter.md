Hi Bentley Team,

I’m Jialiang, a Dublin-based developer who genuinely loves the "under the hood" mechanics of software. While my background is in high-performance engines, I’ve always admired how Bentley Systems builds the digital backbone for the real world—there’s something incredibly satisfying about applying complex code to solve physical infrastructure challenges.

I’m currently the Technical Lead at Lunami Games , where I spend my time balancing high-level **C# architecture** with low-level **C++ optimization**. I’m not just looking to "write code"; I’m looking to build systems that are fast, stable, and meaningful.

Here’s a quick snapshot of what I’ll bring to the team:

- **The "Performance" Mindset:** I’ve managed to push frame rates up by 233% through rigorous render pipeline and batching optimizations.
    
- **Architectural Balance:** I’m a C# expert who understands that software is only as good as its underlying memory management. I’ve built custom editors and frameworks that cut production time by 67%.
    
- **A Focus on Quality:** I believe in "fixing it before it breaks." I established CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to reduce deployment friction by 40%.
    

I recently finished my MSc at DCU , I’m living here in Dublin, and I hold a valid Stamp 1G permit. I’m ready to jump in and start solving problems with you.

Thanks for taking a look at my application. I’d love to chat about how my "game-engine" approach to performance can help Bentley’s civil engineering apps stay world-class.

Best,
Jialiang Xin
