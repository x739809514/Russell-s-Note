### **EXPERIENCE**

**LUNAMI GAMES** | **Dublin, Ireland** **Technical Lead / Senior Software Engineer** **June 2025 – Present**

- **Architected** a scalable core framework using MVC and event-driven patterns, integrating FSM-based AI and progression systems. 
    
- **Managed** memory optimization through Object Pooling architecture, resulting in a 20% reduction in memory consumption. 
    
- **Created** a custom narrative and camera editor using C#/.NET, which reduced content creation time by 67%. 
    
- **Established** CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and Unity Cloud Build, reducing deployment time by 40%. 
    
- **Directed** render pipeline and batching optimizations that achieved a 233% improvement in frame rates (30 to 100+ FPS). 
    

**TECHNICAL PROJECTS (C++)** | **Remote/Personal** **Physically Based Path Tracing Renderer**

- **Implemented** Monte Carlo integration for realistic light distribution and solved global illumination via importance sampling. 
    
- **Managed** complex memory layouts using RAII and Smart Pointers to ensure zero memory leaks. 
    
- **Collaborated** with multi-threaded intersection engines to achieve physically accurate rendering with soft shadows and specular reflections. 
    
- **Additional impact**: Achieved high-fidelity rendering of spheres and planes through optimized C++ systems. 
    

**TECHNICAL PROJECTS (C++)** | **Remote/Personal** **High-Performance Bullet Hell Engine**

- **Created** a memory-aligned Entity Component System (ECS) to handle high-concurrency entity processing. 
    
- **Established** a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions and CMake for automated cross-platform builds and unit testing. 
    
- **Led** the development of a custom GLSL-based batch rendering system to maintain a stable 144 FPS with 5,000+ active entities.
