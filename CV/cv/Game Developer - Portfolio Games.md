## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Lunami Games [Story-driven Puzzle Game - PC] | 06/2025 - Present

**Technical Lead**
• Architected core game framework (save system, input management, MVC) and gameplay systems (quest, narrative, AI with FSM, camera).
• **Implemented A/B testing framework** with 15+ experiments. Integrated Unity Analytics, increasing Day-1 retention from 42% to 58%.
• Developed narrative editor integrating camera, dialogue, VFX, and AI (67% workflow improvement). **Optimized Spine animation** using GPU skinning (30 to 100+ FPS).
• **Deployed hot-fix solutions** for 8 critical bugs using ILRuntime. Reduced crash rate from 3.2% to 0.8% via crash analytics monitoring.
• Led Agile/Scrum development. Established CI/CD pipeline, reducing deployment time by 40%.

### Shanghai Leiyu Network [Kepler: Last Stand - PC/Console] | 03/2022 - 01/2023

**Unity Programmer**
• Designed scalable UI framework with object pooling (20% memory reduction) and dynamic camera system with Cinemachine (35% occlusion reduction). Developed project utilities improving team efficiency by 20%.
• **Implemented player tracking system** monitoring active player count and calculating retention rates per level. Built server-side analytics providing insights to improve high drop-off areas.
• Created boss fight mechanics (FSM) and combat system (ECS architecture). **Conducted rapid A/B tests on combat difficulty**, validating balance changes within 24-48 hours.
• Implemented cross-platform input with Unity Input System. Collaborated with QA, designers, and artists in Agile sprints.

### Hangzhou Shenghe Network [Legend - Mobile MMORPG] | 03/2021 - 02/2022

**Unity Developer**
• Implemented client-server architecture with state synchronization for real-time multiplayer. Designed message protocols and data serialization for network communication.
• **Optimized performance for massive multiplayer scenarios** using LOD system and quadtree spatial partitioning. Maintained 60+ FPS with dozens of concurrent players. **Troubleshot memory leaks** using Unity Profiler, reducing memory from 850MB to 620MB (27% reduction).
• Developed UI with xlua framework and A* pathfinding with hierarchical optimization. Designed red dot notification system (25% reduction in redundant notifications).

## TECHNICAL SKILLS

**Core Development** (4+ years, shipped/upcoming titles across mobile/PC/console)  
• Excellent C# and OOP with design patterns (Singleton, Observer, Factory, Command). Strong MVC architecture, event-driven design. Experienced in client-server architecture and network programming with state synchronization.

**Unity Engine & Systems**  
• Strong Unity engine knowledge with performance optimization and memory management. Experienced with Unity Input System, Cinemachine, Playables & Animation System, custom Editor tools. Expert in ECS and FSM architectures. Proficient in UI frameworks with object pooling and LOD systems.

**Performance & Development Practices**  
• Optimization & troubleshooting: Unity Profiler (CPU/GPU/memory), draw call reduction, atlas batching, TextMeshPro. Proficient in ILRuntime and Lua (xlua) for hot-fixes. Git, build tools, deployment pipelines.
• Data-driven development: A/B testing frameworks, analytics integration (Unity Analytics), custom event tracking, player behavior monitoring. Telemetry data for design decisions.
• Agile/Scrum methodologies. CI/CD pipelines (Unity Cloud Build, GitHub Actions). Code review, pair programming, cross-functional collaboration. Live operations: hot-fix deployment, crash analytics monitoring.
